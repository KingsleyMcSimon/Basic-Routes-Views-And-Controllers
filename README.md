# About The Project:

Get the chance to interact with Rails application from the command line by sending requests manually. First build a very simple app (to get some practice with the steps involved in creating a new one) and then a simple script which uses the RestClient gem to send some requests and examine the server output.

# Built With:

Ruby On Rails.

# Getting Started With The Project:

Application Skeleton
First you need to create a simple Rails app:

1. Create a new Rails application “rest-tester” (remember the $ rails new command?). Go (cd) into the application folder and open it up in a text editor.
2. Let’s start from the top – creating the routes necessary to serve up our users. Go to config/routes.rb and add the users resources with resources :users.
3. Verify by using $ rake routes on the command line.
